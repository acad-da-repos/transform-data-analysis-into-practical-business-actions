# Transform Data Analysis into Practical Business Actions Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will translate data analysis findings into actionable business recommendations. This is a crucial step in demonstrating the value of data analysis to stakeholders.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find a function definition: `generate_recommendations(sales_data)`.
3.  Your task is to analyze the `sales_data` (a Pandas DataFrame with 'Product' and 'Sales' columns) and generate a list of business recommendations based on the following criteria:
    *   Identify the top 3 best-selling products.
    *   Identify any products with sales below a certain threshold (e.g., 100).
4.  The function should return a list of strings, where each string is a recommendation.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How can you quantify the potential impact of your recommendations?
*   Explore different ways to present your recommendations to different audiences (e.g., executives, marketing team).
*   How can you track the implementation and effectiveness of your recommendations?
